# Elk is in early alpha ⚠️ 

It is already quite usable, but it isn't ready for wide adoption yet. We recommend you to use if if you would like to help us building it. 

If you would like to get involved, join the [Elk discord server](https://chat.elk.zone) to chat with us and learn more about the project.
